# Vue.js Project Standards

- Always use Windtail (Tailwind CSS) for styling components. Do not use inline or other CSS frameworks unless necessary.
- Place all style blocks at the top of the .vue file, before script and template.
- Use script setup syntax for new components.
- Enforce PascalCase for component names and file names.
- Use camelCase for props and data properties.
- All components must implement error handling for API calls and user actions.
- Use centralized error handling where possible (e.g., global error boundary or error store).
- Follow SOLID principles in component and service design.
- Use Vuex or Pinia for state management if shared state is needed.

- Always use Pinia stores for all business and application logic; do not place logic directly in components.
- All error handling must be routed through the snackbar menu for user feedback.
